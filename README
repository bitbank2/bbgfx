*** BBGFX ***

BBGFX is a C/ASM library of graphics primitives primarily targeted at embedded
and bare metal environments. The benefit of BBGFX over other graphics libraries is
that the functions are written in optimized ARMv5 assembly language. This makes it
useful for less capable ARM systems such as the Cortex-M series or Raspberry Pi's
using the BCM2835 (ARMv6) CPU. BBGFX contains primitives for working with bitmaps,
lines, circles, rectangles and supports operations with transparency and
translucency. 

Here's the demo code running on a Raspberry Pi Zero and SPI LCD display:

To build the library, simply type 'make' in the terminal. To build the demo
app, type 'make -f make_demo'. This will build the 'bbgfxdemo' executable to show
that the library is working. By default, the demo will send output to /dev/fb0. It
can also send output to a SPI-connected LCD using my SPI_LCD library. The fb0 device
is assumed to be configured for either 32 or 16-bits per pixel.

BBGFX depends on image functions in a limited version of my imaging library
called 'mini_pil' - mini portable imaging library. This code is included 
with this repo.
